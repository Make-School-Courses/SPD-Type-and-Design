# Type Hierarchy

One of the most important tasks when designing type is to create a hierarchy.
People scan a page rather than reading everything top to bottom.

The text on a page can be broken down into smaller blocks that each serve a
 function and provide different types of information your viewers are
 interested in. By giving each of these blocks a different style you make your
 product more accessible, understandable, and help people make sense of what
 you are presenting.

## Your task

Open the example use type styles to create a type hierarchy. Your first and
most important step is to identify the different elements in the text. These
might be things like:

- headings
- subheadings
- footers
- quotes
- prices
- descriptions
- etc.

Use these design concepts to complete the challenges:

- Color
- Size
- Weight
- Font Style
- Type Contrast
- Position

You can style the examples in Sketch. You can try these further challenges:

- The text has also been provided as HTML style this with CSS.
- Style both the Sketch file, and the HTML file.
- Style the Sketch file first, then use CSS and HTML to recreate what you see in sketch.
- The Xcode project contains two view controllers in Storyboard. Style these
using the built in UI elements: UILabel, UITextView, UIImageView etc.
