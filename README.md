# Design

Design is about communication. As a designer it is your job to 
communicate the values of your product with your audience.

> **Design:** 
> 1. to conceive or execute a plan
> 2. to devise for a specific function or end
> 3. to indicate with a distinctive mark, sign, or name
> 4. to make a drawing, pattern, or sketch of

A product has a purpose, and it's producer values. These should be 
expressed in the design.

> “There are three responses to a piece of design – yes, no, and WOW! 
> Wow is the one to aim for.”
> - **Milton Glaser**

## Why do some things look better than others?

Check out [this website](https://kickpush.co)
visit the web page, pay close attention to the type. With a partner
Decide what you like and what is working well?

Answer these questions: 

- What do you think about the typography?
- What has the designer done with type to make this interesting?
  - Name three things
- What is the message? 
  - What do they do?
  - How do they do it?
  - What are their values?
  
Let's do that again. Check out this [site](http://www.petersbuss.se) with a partner

- What do you think about the typography?
- What did the designer want you to see?
  - First 
  - Second
  - Third
- What are they doing worng? 

## Design Features

Design has these features (in other words you have these features 
to express your message):

- Typography
- Color
- Layout
- Everything else...

## Typography

The most common form of content in the apps you create is text.
For this lesson we will focus on typography.

### Talking about Typography 

__Terms__

![Type-Terms](./Notes/Type-Terms.png)

Actually there are many more [terms](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/d8/08/58d8080befdcf6e9f780aa1e1d0cc59e.jpg)

The terms above are most important for layout. Understanding these 
will help explain a lot of the strange behavior you might have 
experienced working with type, and the options present in software
dealing with type.

__Kerning__

The space between characters

__Leading__

The space between lines

__Fonts__

__Serif vs San Serif__

__Serif__

Each of these type faces has a different character. Each has 
a different voice. Think of where you may have seen these 
faces before and what the message was.

# Type Hierarchy

__A majority of your content is text.__ Your text needs to look good 
and read well. An important part of communication is the order in which 
you say things.

**Design your type to control the order in which your content is read**.

This image explains it all.

You can use these design elements to create hierarchy in your type:

- Color
- Position
- Size
- Type Contrast 
- Weight

### Identify Hierarchy in the wild

Follow one of more of the links below, and look for elements listed above in
the designs. 

Work with a partner. Explore the links below discuss ideas above. Try and find 
an example of each idea (color, position, size, style, Type Contrast, weight).

### Exercise

This is your opportunity to apply some of the ideas yourself. 

Understanding that everyone is working in different areas I 
have supplied three different formats to work in. 

1. [Sketch](./exercise/Type-Hierarchy-Example) - If you have Sketch and want to work in a purely 
visual design form you can solve the problems in sketch. 
2. [HTML/CSS](./exercise/Type-Exercise-html) - Use this to solve the problems with CSS. 
3. [Xcode](./exercise/Type-Hierarchy) - Use storyboard to solve the problems.  

The starter project and files are in the folder below. 

- [Type-Hierarchy-Example](./exercise/)

There are two examples. 

The first is a wikipedia entry with: 

- Title 
- Subheading
- Description
- Image

The second is a product description with:

- Brand 
- Title
- Description
- List
- Disclaimer
- Image

Feel free to work with all elements in any way you like. 
The goal is to make a single block of text that is easy to 
understand. Ask yourself these questions as you work. 

- Show a visual hierarchy what should viewers read first?
- Each of the pieces of content has a style sets it apart 
from the other elements.
