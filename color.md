# Color

Color is expressive.

## Additive and subtractive color

In ink and paint color is subtractive. The more colors you add
the more your color moves to black. When no color is present 
you have white. 

When color is presented via light color is additive. When you 
have no color you have black, as you add light of various 
colors you work your way to white.
